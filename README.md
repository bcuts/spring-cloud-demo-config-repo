Getting Started with Spring Cloud, by Josh Long and Dr. Dave Syer, provides an excellent end-to-end technical overview of the latest Spring and Netflix technologies. The presentation, available on YouTube, was given at SpringOne2GX 2015.

The accompanying post examines the technologies, components, code, and configuration presented in Getting Started with Spring Cloud. The goal of the post is to provide a greater understanding of the Spring Cloud and Spring Cloud Netflix technologies.
